# Dr. Robert Bauer‚Äôs AI / GenAI Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub. I‚Äôm Dr. Robert Bauer, based in Dresden‚Äîa researcher, engineer, and strategist deeply passionate about building scalable, secure, and production-ready AI systems. My repositories include GenAI pipelines, private AI tool protocols, and sentiment analytics frameworks.

##  Featured Projects

### 1. Advanced RAG System ‚Äì **paper-qa**
**Tech stack:** Python ¬∑ LangChain ¬∑ LlamaIndex ¬∑ ChromaDB ¬∑ Streamlit ¬∑ FastAPI ¬∑ MLflow  
**Highlights:**
- Ingests and processes PDFs, DOCX, TXT, HTML  
- Combines dense and sparse retrieval with semantic chunking  
- Provides visual interfacing via Streamlit and FastAPI  
- Supports experiment tracking with MLflow  
- Fully containerized for deployment  

### 2. Sentiment-Driven RAG for Stocks ‚Äì **rag-stock-sentiment**
**Tech stack:** Python (with HTML components)  
**Purpose:** Applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation for sentiment analysis in financial contexts.  
**Note:** Could be enhanced with documentation, deployment tools, and strong architecture diagrams to elevate project professionalism.  [oai_citation:2‚Ä°GitHub](https://github.com/RobertBauer-dev/rag-stock-sentiment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 3. MCP Learning Project ‚Äì **mcp**
**Tech stack:** Python ¬∑ REST + Tool APIs  
**Overview:** Implements the "Model Context Protocol," allowing AI models to interact dynamically with external tools and systems‚Äîeffectively giving AI ‚Äúhands‚Äù to navigate files, systems, databases, and APIs.  
**Core Elements:**
- Modular tool architecture (`file_tools`, `system_tools`)  
- Clear learning objectives and structured development path  
- Lightweight, server-based implementation

##  How to Use These Projects

1. **Clone** your desired repo  
2. **Setup** using a virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. **Configure** environment variables (`.env`, API keys) as needed  
4. **Run**:
   - RAG interface using Streamlit or FastAPI (paper-qa)  
   - MCP‚Äôs server for tool interaction  
5. **Extend**, customize, or deploy the code in scalable/private cloud environments (Docker-ready for production use)

##  Contact & Next Steps

- **Location:** Dresden, Germany

### Tips for Further Enhancement

- Add architecture diagrams (e.g., via `.drawio`, PlantUML, or embedded images) for clarity.
- Include quick-start GIFs or screenshots to showcase the tool interfaces.
- Incorporate testing coverage badges or CI/CD status shields.
- Consider adding a short ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù section, even for your personal repos‚Äîit demonstrates best practices and team readiness.
